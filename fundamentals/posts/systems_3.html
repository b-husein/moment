<p>
  We've talked about what operating systems are in general. We took a look at Microsoft Windows which is the most popular 
  operating system. Now we're gonna be taking a look at Apple's macOS, which has been a fairly small market share operating 
  system over the years, but in recent times it has been growing twofold year over year. It's just gaining more and more market 
  share and becoming more and more common. So we're going to take a look at what macOS is, how it works, how it came about, 
  and see how it differs in some areas but is very, very similar to Microsoft windows, which makes it incredibly easy to use. <br><br>

  In these notes we will see what software we can load, see how it functions, and how we are able to operate inside of an Apple environment, 
  or the Apple ecosystem, all using macOS. Let's start off with the name, and you'll hear people refer to macOS as Mac OS. You hear people 
  call it Mac OS 10 or OS 10, you'll hear that name kind of thrown about. And it all is tied back to history. So macOS is developed by a 
  company called Apple. And Apple has been around since the '70s. If you have not heard of Apple, I don't think that's possible. I think their 
  marketing team has been so effective that everybody's heard of Apple. But it might be because you have an iPhone or iPad or Apple watch. It 
  may not be related to your physical computer at all. But Apple has been a computer company since the 1970s. And they created a series of 
  computers that were designed to give programmers and hobbyists access to their system to be able to do a lot more. <br><br>

  <h4>BRIEF HISTORY</h4> <br>

  Apple was one of the first companies to embrace a graphical user interface. And they released a line of computers called the Apple Macintosh. 
  The Macintosh computers had a GUI, they were easy to use. They had a mouse. You could actually interact with a mouse, not just a keyboard, 
  like a lot of other vendors were doing at the time. And the Macintosh computer is what has evolved over the years to be what we now call a Mac. 
  So when I say it's an Apple Mac, that's actually just short for Apple Macintosh. But that's not me abbreviating it, Apple themselves no longer 
  use the Macintosh term anywhere. When you look at all of their marketing, and branding and so on, you don't see Macintosh, but that is where 
  that originally came from. So the Macs, they've evolved quite a bit over the years as well as the operating system that runs on them. When we 
  talk about a mac, we're talking about the hardware. And the operating system that runs on top of it, well, when the original Macintosh came out, 
  that was called macOS. And it was called macOS for many, many years. And then Apple decided to make a change at one point. <br><br>

  <h4>ABOUT MAC PROCESSORS</h4> <br>

  Macs used to use <strong>proprietary processors.</strong> They used a processor that was called a <strong>PowerPC</strong>. It was a different type of CPU 
  than anybody else was using at the time. Well, I mean, there were a few people, but on a mainstream basis nobody else was using it. It was 
  a very powerful processor, but it made Macs very different. That's why they had to have their own operating system. You couldn't run 
  Microsoft Windows on a Mac. The processor is just different. Well, they decided to make a change to move to standard processors, to 
  Intel-based processors. And when they made that change, that made it where the hardware is very similar to what Microsoft Windows runs on. 
  And Mac OS changed at that time as well, and they rebranded it. Instead of calling it Mac OS, they called it OS 10. And it was called OS X. 
  The letter X is the roman numeral for ten. <br><br>

  And I know it's called OS X for well over ten years. And only recently Apple decided to go back to the old name, back to MacOS. So when you 
  hear people say OS 10, they're not wrong, this is a recent change. So some people call it Mac OS some people call it OS X. The original name 
  was Mac OS, it moved away, now it's back again, and so now it's called Mac OS. And they're doing that to line up with their mobile operating 
  systems. <br><br>

  <h4>ABOUT iOS</h4> <br>

  The iPhone and iPad, they run what's called <strong>iOS.</strong> The ‘i’ for iPhone and iPad. You've got watchOS for the Apple watch, you've got tvOS for the Apple TV. 
  On the Mac, you have macOS, for your mac. So Apple is trying to get the names all synchronized. So when you buy a Mac today, it comes with Mac 
  OS, which is just the latest version of OS X, same basic idea. When you look at it, you have a graphical user interface, and the user interface 
  isn't much different than it was when the system was called OS X. But it is different from the original Mac OS. The original Mac OS was a good 
  bit different. But if I'm running different versions, the screens might look a little bit different. The wallpaper's always different. Apple 
  uses a different wallpaper in each version. But the icons down here in the Dock bar are pretty much the same. Those don't change that much as 
  Apple adds in software and tweaks it a little bit. <br><br>

  But if I go up to my Apple menu up top here, I can choose About this Mac, and I can see that I'm running macOS High Sierra. Now, High Sierra 
  is a code name for this particular version. I'm running version 10.13.4.; 10.13 is High Sierra. 10.12 was called Sierra by itself. 10.11 
  was called El Capitan. They have names that go along with it because people have an easier time remembering a name than a number. 
  So that makes things a little bit confusing on the names. But it's all designed to be, well, in theory, simple. Just MacOS. That's it. 
  I'm not having to worry about all the other details. <br><br>

  <h4>APPLE's DESIGN METHODOLOGY</h4> <br>

  <strong>Apple's design methodology is that they want the system to be easy.</strong>They have this marketing slogan when they say 
  <strong>‘it just works’.</strong> You press the power button, you get into the operating system, and you can get to work right away. It's 
  designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. But if somebody's never used a computer before, they can come in, look at it, and they say, wait a 
  minute, here's this button down here, and if I click on that, it's gonna launch the program. And they don't have to learn, they don't have to 
  take a course to learn how to use Mac OS. They can just stumble through and figure it out. That's the goal. And that's how they launched the 
  Macintosh line way back in the 1980s. All the way to today where the Mac is their standard computer line. This is the main computer product. 
  They actually do sell more iPhones than Macs, which is kind of a weird business model. But the Macs themselves are very reliable, very stable 
  computers, that are very intuitive and easy to use. That's really all a part of what macOS stands for. <br><br>

  <h4>AQUA UI</h4> <br>

  On the other hand, when we look at macOS, <strong>the user interface that we are seeing is actually called Aqua.</strong> When Apple switched 
  the original macOS over to OS X, this UI was developed called Aqua that was designed to be smooth and liquidy. Everything was supposed to, 
  everything used to look like little raindrops. Everything had curved edges and little lighted bezels and fancy artifacts. It's changed a 
  lot over the last decade. And now, things are a lot more flat, like the dock bar down at the bottom of the screen, it's just kind of like 
  this flat grey background. And that's it. <br><br>

  <h4>FINDER</h4> <br>

  It used to be that it looked like glass and kinda reflected a little bit. They do little screen element changes like that. But the interface 
  is still the Aqua interface, but you really don't hear people mention that. What most people mention when they talk about the interface is 
  they'll call it <strong>the Finder</strong>. But the interface is not the Finder. The Finder is just something that runs inside it.  
  <strong>The Finder helps you locate applications and files on your system.</strong> So it is what we interact with a lot. <br><br>

  There's two main ways to interact with the Finder. The first way is with the icon right here. This smiley face with two halves, that's 
  actually the Macintosh icon, but they use it for the Finder application because it's kind of the primary application that we run. If I click 
  on that, it's gonna launch the Finder, and now I can browse through my storage to find any documents, downloads, applications, and other things 
  that I might have on my system. It makes it where I can easily locate information and work with it. So this becomes like one of our primary 
  ways of interacting with the computer. It also has the ability to do a search (similar to search option with Windows). You've got a little 
  magnifying glass up here in your top bar that you can click and it takes you to the Spotlight search. <br><br>
  
  <h4>SPOTLIGHT</h4> <br>
  
  <strong>Spotlight is a system hooked into the 
  finder that is indexing all of our files</strong>, all of our applications, all of our folders, to make it easy to find. But not just that. It also 
  indexes things on the web, so that we can do searches across the Internet. If I want to search for HP Easy Start, and I type in hp easy, it 
  finds HP Easy Start right there in my system and I can run it. <br><br>

  As you use the computer, the Spotlight learns a little bit more about stuff you frequently access, stuff you infrequently access. And these 
  search results get more and more and more accurate over time so that it becomes very robust. So when we interact with macOS using the Finder 
  and using Spotlight, those are two tools that make things really simple. And that's really how we interact. But it's all being delivered via 
  the Aqua User Interface to make it look nice on our screen. Aqua gives us these three buttons. The red button to close the window, the yellow 
  button to minimize it and get it out of the way, and the green button to go full screen. If I'm browsing the web, for example, and I know I'm 
  gonna be browsing the web for a while, I'm gonna be looking at the obvious web page today, so I'm gonna be on this for a little while. I can 
  hit that green button to go full screen, and when I do that, it's gonna go full screen and all the other screen elements disappear. <br><br>

  Switching between windows is an important part of any user interface. It facilitates making it where we can access these. Now, when you go 
  full screen, it's kind of like, how do I multi-task? How do I launch another program if I'm stuck here in full screen? You can do this little 
  three finger swipe gesture on your touchpad. And it lets you move in between the different environments. That's all powered by the user interface. 
  And giving you things like gestures on the keyboard, that's designed to be easily accessible for people. I'm not having to remember, I need to 
  hit Control + Command + X. I just swipe three fingers. That's something simple people can interact with. That's really part of that design 
  methodology macOS, and you see it carried through everywhere, trying to make things as easy as possible. <br><br>

  So in Microsoft Windows, when we had drives they showed up with a drive letter. I had a C: drive and a D: drive. Apple doesn't do that. 
  Apple just gives them a name. So your Mac will likely have a hard drive in it and that hard drive is usually just called <strong>Macintosh HD</strong>. 
  There's that Macintosh name, kinda sneaks in on us. When I come into my Finder we cannot see our drive here because your average user 
  doesn't need to browse to their regular drive. Up in my top menu up here, you'll see the Go menu. And under Go, you'll see those same 
  places that you can navigate, but there's one extra one in the list. Computer. And if I click on that to go to My Computer, now I see 
  the Macintosh HD sitting right there. And I can browse into it, and I can start navigating that file system and seeing my storage and so 
  on. But that being said, we don't really mess with most of these folders. The folder that we mess with is our home folder. <br><br>

  If I start plugging in additional hard drives, they'll all show up under that computer window where I was just at a moment ago. So 
  I choose Go and Computer, they'll all show up in here, and they'll just have a name, whatever they're named. I'll name mine easy things 
  like Time Machine or Storage or whatever, depending on what I'm gonna use it for. My storage one, that's where I keep files. My time machine 
  one, that's where I put my time machine backups. And those names are easy to address. I don't have to look at it and say, look, there's an S 
  drive. What is S? S may stand for storage, it might stand for something else, I don't know. So here, we just have a name and that makes life a 
  lot easier. <br><br>

  Apple uses what are called <strong>mount points.</strong> These are actually getting mounted to a file system. And to give you guys an idea what this looks like 
  if we did it the hard way, let me drop to the terminal. When we use macOS, what we see is the Aqua user interface. And it is smooth, and easy, 
  and intuitive, and anybody can figure it out. But in the background, macOS is actually running <strong>BSD Unix</strong>, it's running a very powerful server 
  operating system. But it just has a super-easy UI stuck on top of it. And if I drop down to that basic operating system that's behind the scenes, 
  I can start to kinda unravel the mystery of what all is going on. And when I look in the file system, here I can find where there's that Macintosh 
  hard drive, where it's mounted to the file system and any time I plug in another drive, it's doing this. It's mounting them here, fortunately, 
  you don't have to  drop to the terminal and navigate into this to find it because the UI shows it. <br><br>

  We see it in the graphical user interface, through the finder, and we don't have to navigate through this. But this is the actual operating 
  system behind the scene, the kernel for Mac OS, the actual operating system is built on BSD Unix and it's called <strong>Darwin</strong>. So that is a 
  very powerful, very stable, very robust operating system that is very unuser friendly like most users could not even run a program inside 
  of <strong>Darwin</strong>, better yet actually operate on a normal basis. Apple uses that though because it's stable and powerful and it's a network 
  operating system through and through and it is very robust. <br><br>

  And then where their real claim to fame is, is they take that nightmare of a difficult OS, and then they turn it into the easiest operating 
  system to use on the planet, Mac OS. It's simple, you can stick it in front of your grandparents, and they can dive in and start to get things 
  done with just a moderate level of clicking around and exploring. They can figure it out, we don't have to have documentation and things that's 
  a big deal. <br><br>

  When it comes to a hard drive, you can't necessarily move a hard drive from a MAC to a Windows machine and back and forth. When we talk 
  about Windows we talk about their file system they have, the NTFS or New Technology File System. Well, Apple has their own file systems. 
  They have the <strong>High Performance File System or HFS</strong>, that is usually called MAC OS Extended. They also have a new one which is called <strong>APFS</strong>, 
  or the <strong>Apple File System</strong>. Those file systems are different from what you have in Microsoft Windows, but they provide very similar functionality. 
  When I launch my finder and I start browsing through the hard drive, I'm browsing through my file system. It's telling it what folders are here 
  and what files are inside of that. It's all learning that from the file system. <br><br>

  And when I have files, like my HP Easy Start here that in the file system, it's keeping track of various settings and options, like I can give 
  them color tags. The file system is allowing it to keep track of what those file tags are. It's called <strong>metadata</strong>, it's tracking that metadata and 
  you'll see other options, like the ability to lock a file, or so on. You can set permissions on a file, and control who can access it. So very 
  similar to NTFS, where it gives us the same kind of functionality, Apple's File System is doing that as well. It's just doing it in a way that's 
  not really observant, we don't see it. But if I were to do something like go into the <strong>Disk Utility</strong>, I launch the disk utility. And I take a look 
  at my disk, I can see it right here, that this one's actually formatted with the Apple File System, APFS. <br><br>

  <strong>And APFS is not supported by Windows, just like NTFS from Windows is not supported by Apple.</strong> They're proprietary, they're tied to their own 
  operating systems. So we always have to be aware that this is a function of Mac OS. The APFS, the Apple File System is only supported by Mac OS, 
  so if you want APFS you've got to run Mac OS. <br><br>

  Apple has done a great job in making it super easy to <strong>install applications</strong>. On the Windows side, we had to download the installer and run it 
  and you'll click through a wizard and so on. On the Apple side, they do have what are called application bundles. For example, I'm gonna go and 
  download Sublime Text, it's gonna go into my Downloads folder, when I run that installer, it's gonna open it up as if it was another hard drive. 
  And so it's gonna open right up and I'm gonna see this virtual disk, it's like a fake hard drive. Here is the application Sublime Text, and here's 
  a shortcut to my application's folder. So to install Sublime Text I just drag it and drop it on the applications folder. And that just installed 
  Sublime Text. I've actually got it installed, and it's running. Well, actually it's not running yet. If I go into my Applications folder, though, 
  I can find Sublime Text in here. I can double-click on it, and it's gonna launch. <br><br>

  And it's giving me a warning saying this was downloaded from the internet am I sure I wanna run it. I can hit Open, and then it's gonna pop up 
  and I can work, I can start typing text and so on. It's installed and it was easy. And then, if I decide that I don't want it anymore, I'm done 
  with Sublime Text, I wanna uninstall it. I just take that icon and I drag it and my head's actually gonna cover this up, so down in the bottom 
  right corner of my screen. I can take that and I can drag it down to my trash bin and I can just drop it off there and it deletes it and now I've 
  uninstalled Sublime Text. It's designed to be easy. And that was, you're just dragging and dropping the file. That installs the program and 
  uninstalls the program. <br><br>

  It's even easier if I use the App store. If I fire up Apple's App store, I can come in here and I can find applications and install them. 
  Once it's installed, I can run it and maybe it's floating in the background. In Mac OS, it's actually really easy to forget that you left a 
  program running. Because, for example, if I close this window, it's gonna ask if I wanna save it, I'm not going to, and I close it. In our 
  taskbar, it still says Sublime Text is running. I closed the window I was working in, but the program is indeed still running. And that's 
  because I might wanna come in here and create a new file, and now I'm right back into it. Well, if you wanna see what's running on your mac, 
  you easily see it down here in your dock. The dock has actually gotten bigger. It gets bigger on the right under my head, but when I run 
  sublime text down here you'll see it added to the list. <br><br>

  And there's the Disk Utility and they got a little <strong>dot beneath them</strong> letting me know that they're actually running. If I launch the App 
  Store now it's got a dot beneath it. So that's one way to keep track of what's running on your system and to know if an application is still 
  out there doing something. We also have the <strong>activity monitor</strong>. If I fire up the activity monitor, it's very similar to the task manager in Windows. 
  I can see all the programs that are running on my computer and I can come in here and look. I'll just sort it alphabetically here, I can look 
  and see, is Sublime Text running? If I poke around, I should be able to find it, there's Sublime Text still running in the background. And I see 
  a lot of other things too. I see applications that I run, but I also see services and other processes that are running in the background that are 
  just trying to make life easier for me. <br><br>

  Somethings like Spotlight. <strong>Spotlight</strong> is indexing the storage of my system, so I can search and find things. So Spotlight needs to run in the 
  background so it can find stuff. Software update is running software updates to make sure that my system stays updated, if there's a vulnerability, 
  a virus, or whatever. Apple will push an update out to make sure that I don't get infected. Software updates will run in the background and 
  do that. That's all being powered by macOS, it's taking care of managing all that for me so I don't have to worry about it. <br><br>

  Because this is built on top of Unix, which is a multi-user operating system, macOS is a multi-user operating system as well. It carries over 
  that feature. Right now, I'm just logged in as me. And when you get a brand new Mac and you set it up the first time, it walks you through a 
  basic series of setting up your first user account. So you have one user account. But if you want more, you can just go into your system 
  preferences. If I hit my Apple up top, and I go to <strong>System Preferences</strong>, I'll see a lot of settings that I can configure and change here in 
  my system. Very similar to the Control Panel on Windows. Here I have the system preferences for a Mac. And way down here at the bottom, 
  I've got <strong>Users and Groups</strong>. I can dive into that, and here I see my user account and there is also a guest account that's disabled by default, 
  it's off. So there's just one user account. And I can come in and I can add more. <br><br>

  Now, I need to be an administrator to do it, so the tool is locked. I'm gonna unlock that and provide my password so it knows that I'm an 
  administrator. And once I authenticate, now I can add in more users. So I can just hit that little plus here, and I'll create an account for 
  someone else. So I'm gonna create that account, and just provide a password for him to use, and then I'll create that user. And there we go, 
  he appears right there, as a standard user. <br><br>

  The important part is that my user account might have my documents, my private information, things I don't wanna share with other people. And when 
  a guest user logs in, I want him to have his own experience, his own documents. Maybe he hates this wallpaper, he hates nature and doesn't 
  wanna look at mountains and craziness, he wants something more simple. Well, maybe I like the mountains, I wanna keep it. He can log in as 
  himself and he will see his own background environment. So I'm gonna switch over to a guest account this time. And that's gonna take me to 
  the login screen, so you can log in. And when he logs in, he'll see his environment, which is separate from mine. <br><br>

  So now I have data privacy, we have customized experience that's tailored to each of us. And now we can use the computer our own way and know 
  that our data is secure. Now, he's logging in technically for the first time, so it has to set up a few basic things, it's building his profile. 
  I'm gonna just try and skip through this as quickly as I can so we don't go through it. They want you to set up an Apple ID, and configure iTunes, 
  and all this other crazy stuff. So we'll skip past that. Microsoft does the same thing, they want you to set up a Live ID and all that. And here I 
  am. So now I'm at guest desktop. But now when I come to the computer, I can switch over to my user account. And when I log in as me, I get my 
  mountains back. We each have our own experience. That's a key thing, especially in a business environment, where users need to have their own 
  space for storing data, keeping it secure and private. For a home user, maybe you don't care, you just use a single account. But for businesses, 
  you almost always need to have multiple user accounts like this. <br><br>

  In conclusion, macOS is actually a really powerful operating system, it can do a lot more than what we mentioned here. This was really just 
  designed to be a primer, a quick preview of the operating system. If you want to learn more about macOS, it's covered in the CompTIA A+ exam, 
  a little bit more as far as troubleshooting and how the OS works, as operating systems go, know that macOS is designed to be the easiest to use, 
  but it's also designed to run just on Apple's hardware. So you have a much more limited use case scenario for where you can use macOS versus some 
  of the other operating systems that are out there. <br><br>

  Now this was just a tip of the iceberg related to macOS, in the next post I will write about GNU Linux and basic 
  functions of that operating system.
