  <p class="post-meta-data">by Husein</p>

<!-- <div><img src="../img/code.png" alt=""></div> -->

<p>
  In this post, we're gonna be diving into more operating systems, and more specifically, taking a look at GNU Linux, which is a 
  very misunderstood operating system for a lot of people, especially if you’re new to computers or just getting into IT. Because 
  Linux has a pretty interesting history. It is primarily a server based operating system. So you’ll see it used in tons of websites 
  and Internet infrastructure that’s out there. But it is also a desktop operating system, which means you may be running it on your 
  laptop or desktop right now. Odds are you aren't, it actually has a very small market share in the desktop side, so a lot of us haven't 
  been exposed to it. But when you jump into the server world, Linux actually has the majority of the market share, and so it is a very heavily 
  deployed operating system. <br><br>

  <h4>HISTORY</h4>

  Linux is different than the other OSs that we've talked about, that are owned by corporations. You have the Microsoft Windows and the 
  Apple macOS. Here you have GNU/Linux, which is an open operating system that is free, that anybody can download and create, and modify, 
  and just have ultimate access to it. Which is partly why it's been so successful in the server world. So in this post, we're gonna take a 
  look at Linux, how it functions, what it does, what kinda makes it different from the other OSs that are out there, and just kinda get our 
  feet wet with an operating system we don't normally get exposed to. Linux was released in the early 1990s. And basically it's the product 
  of Linus Torvalds. And he was at a university where he was working on a mainframe system that ran the MINIX operating system which was based 
  on Unix. So Unix was an operating system that came out of AT&T Laboratories in the 1970s. It was designed as a programmer's operating system, 
  and it was designed for systems that were way too expensive and complex for any normal person to have. So you only had access to them when you 
  were working for large corporations or when you were at universities. <br><br>

  <h4>GNU TOOLS</h4>

  The kernel is inside of Linux and it gotta be surrounded by other things. It's gotta be surrounded by a graphical user interface. It's got to 
  be surrounded by a command line interface, and commands, the actual tools that we run. Well, Linus didn't create all of that. Instead, his 
  kernel gets packaged with a number of other tool sets to create what we generally refer to as Linux. And the most popular tool set is one 
  called the GNU tools. And the GNU tools are free and open source tools that provide you with things like a Bash command line interface, and 
  other tools that are available, to be able to function. It's all from several different projects. So unlike Microsoft Windows where the entire 
  operating system comes from Microsoft, or macOS where the entire operating system comes from Apple, when you deal with Linux, the operating 
  system comes from hundreds, thousands of different companies and people that have all contributed code for free to come together and form up 
  an operating system. And because it's all free, anybody can change it. <br><br>

  <h4>OPEN SOURCE DISTROS</h4>

  It's free, it's open source, anybody can run it. Linux takes so many different forms. A website called DistroWatch put together what they 
  call the Linux family tree a few years ago. Where they map out all the different Linux distributions that are available, where people have 
  packaged the Linux kernel with other systems to make an operating system. And it is a massive diagram, it is literally thousands of different 
  versions, basically, there are thousands of Linux distributions out there, and they started with one or two original distributions. 
  And from there, they have grown to expand out into all of these little derivative works. So when I say the Linux operating system, maybe you're 
  running one of these core versions. But in the Linux world there are a handful of distributions that are very, very popular that are considered 
  core that a lot of people run. So for example - Fedora Linux. We can run Fedora Linux on my own personal machine. In the workplace we usually 
  run Red Hat Linux, which is right here, and you'll see where Red Hat has forked, and been given numerous names from other companies that have 
  used it to create their own Linux. <br><br>

  But the most popular one is a distribution called Ubuntu. And it's actually a derivative itself. It's built off of a distribution called Debian. 
  If you're just getting started with Linux, if you have never used it before and you want to experiment with it, Ubuntu is probably the best one, 
  as far as being the most stable, and user-friendly, and easy to implement. In a business sense, companies typically rely on more stable versions 
  of Linux like Red Hat. Red Hat is probably the most stable, and it's commercially supported. Ubuntu is a little more cutting edge, and as a result 
  is a little less stable. <br><br>

  We can run Linux for absolutely free. And in fact with Linux they're more willing to support older hardware too because they don't make money 
  off of hardware sales. So they don't care if you're using a laptop that came out this year or a laptop that came out 10 years ago. You can 
  load a Linux distribution on there and it'll typically run really, really well, even on low hardware. All right, now, as I describe this, 
  some of you are probably thinking, all right. With Microsoft, they are a multi-billion dollar company. They have hundreds of thousands of 
  employees. Obviously they're gonna create a great, rock-solid product. Apple, they're a multi-billion dollar company with hundreds of thousands 
  of employees. And they create a rock-solid product that everybody knows and is familiar with. Linux on the other hand is pretty much cobbled 
  together by hobbyists and amateurs and people that aren't being directly paid to develop for it. So it's probably not as good, right? 
  But you'd be really surprised. <br><br>

  Universities have largely latched on to Linux, as a great way to learn and teach. And so you have a lot of students, a lot of people who, 
  ultimately will go and work for Microsoft, or will go and work for Apple, that are working in the Linux space. And creating better hardware 
  support and functionality, so that we end up with a fully featured operating system that is easy to use, that is able to compete against Windows 
  and against Mac OS. So, let’s just go back to Ubuntu Linux, which is made by a company called Canonical. And it's built off of Debian Linux, 
  which is another free version. Ubuntu is free, Debian is free, Fedora is free. Most of the distros that we can find nowadays are free. 
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not free, you have to buy that one. But most of the others are free. And then if you want support, you pay for 
  support if you need it. But if I just wanna throw Linux onto a desktop, I can. Like here, I did Ubuntu and I didn't have to pay for it. Now 
  it's up and it's running and I've got a graphical user interface. I've got tools and resources just like any other distro that I can use, but 
  it's just a bunch of things put together. So for example, the Linux kernel is running under the hood, deep down inside it. <br><br>

  The people at Canonical took the Linux kernel and they put the GNOME user interface on top of this and it's running the X window manager so 
  that when I run my applications they are being displayed on screen in various windows and I can have multiple windows open. They've added, 
  like that terminal that I just opened, that's actually not part of the kernel, that's just a terminal called bash. And so, the bash shell is 
  running right here, so that I can interact with the system and issue commands and so on. I didn't have to put this all together myself. 
  Canonical did it for me. And so now I've got this consistent user environmentྲ. And if I have a hundred laptops, I can put Ubuntu Linux in 
  all hundred of them and they'll all look and function the same way. And you'll see that for the most part the screen elements are aligned with 
  Windows and Mac OS. That if you can use one OS, you can usually jump over and start to use the other one. So there's a lot of similarity and 
  overlap in between the different operating systems. <br><br>

  <h4>GNOME UI</h4>

  So GNOME is certainly the most popular user interface. But there are other ones that are out there. In fact if you go and download Ubuntu 
  from the Ubuntu web page, the default is to have the Gnome interface. Well if you go and download Fedora, it defaults to Gnome as well. 
  And if you download several different distros, all default to the Gnome UI. So I can install Fedora, or Ubuntu, or Debian, and they all 
  look the same. They are different under the hood. The people who put them together made different decisions on different things. Like Ubuntu 
  uses a different shell than Fedora does. But at first glance, the desktop does look the same. But there are other desktops out there. When you 
  go to download Ubuntu, sure it defaults to Gnome, but you have other choices. And so when I download it, see here it's telling me I can download 
  the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, or long-term support version. But over here, we've got CR alternative downloads. And if you take a look at the alternative 
  downloads, they'll show you a number of differences. Though I could just scroll down for it, let me click over to it. A number of alternative 
  versions of Ubuntu. Many of which use different user interfaces and let's see, right here past it's shoot they call them flavors and let me just 
  search for it and find it. Where they use alternative user interfaces. <br><br>

  So for example there's the XFCE is a user interface that's very streamlined, there's KDE there's LXDE, see this screen right here. I'm on 
  www.ubuntu.com/downloads/flavours; Or, anyhow so these are different ones if you don't like that GNOME interface, you can always put in a 
  different one. In fact, the current version of GNOME is GNOME Version three. Some people really don't like it and they like GNOME Version two. 
  So you'll see down here Ubuntu MATE. MATE is actually GNOME two, the people continue to develop instead of moving over to GNOME three. So you 
  have that choice. You have that flexibility. You compare that to Windows or Mac OS or you don't. They've made that choice. You have this one 
  interface. That's what you get. With Linux, it's all about choice. It's all about options. Now, that is a double-edged sword. On one hand, 
  you have people like me where I like that. I like having the choice that I can configure it however I want and I can pick and choose the 
  components and build the OS that's perfect for me. But I'm a technical user. Right? I'm used to that, I've worked with Linux a long time, 
  I know what I like, and I can do that. Your average end user doesn't want that. They wanna browse the web. They wanna just be able to get in 
  and run their programs, they don't wanna fidget about changing a user interface, or tweaking performance, or whatever. They don't wanna worry 
  about it. <br><br>

  Apple's mantra of, it just works, well that's what a lot of people want. Or Microsoft, where Microsoft is worried not so much about giving you 
  choice, but about making it where as many applications can run as possible. Each company has a different focus. Apple wants things to be easy, 
  Microsoft wants to support as many applications as possible, Linux wants to give you the choice to design things the way that you want. It's 
  different. And that's how people usually end up picking an operating system. So, each of these user interfaces, though, are just that. 
  They're just user interfaces. They might look different, but the functionality they provide is actually very similar. Xubuntu uses the XFCE 
  user interface, which is very, very streamlined. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles like crazy shadow effects and fade in and fade 
  out when you launch a window. It's designed for performance. If you have a low end machine, or you still want to waste resources like memory 
  and processor on fancy graphics? XFCE is great for that. So you have that choice. You pick based on your own needs. And you can even install 
  more than one UI and switch in-between them. <br><br>

  <h4>NAUTILUS AND THUNAR</h4>

  That's easy enough to do. You have that flexibility. I'm showing all this with Ubuntu, Fedora is the same way. Red Hat, Enterprise, Linux, 
  Santos. They're all the same way. They all have where you can snap on different user interfaces if you want. If you find one that you're 
  really really comfortable with. Related to file browsing, in Linux, we have a file manager. And your file manager actually does vary based 
  on which user interface you're in. So I'm in GNOME right now. So it says the GNOME file manager. And so if I click on my file screen here, I 
  can browse through. And this is a component of GNOME. If you're using other systems, then they might have a different file manager. This one, 
  I believe that the actual code name for it is Nautilus. You'll hear people call it Nautilus. There's another one called Thunar which is the 
  default in XFCE and some of the other interfaces. <br><br>

  <h4>EXTENDED FILE SYSTEM - EXT</h4>

  But for the most part they look the same and they look similar to what we've seen in other operating systems. I can navigate through my file 
  system. I'm looking at my desktop, documents, downloads, music, writing. And this is all stuff that's in my home folder. But I can also browse 
  my regular file system and start to explore the hard drive. So I see the computer right here and I can browse through my hard drive. And find 
  resources and files, so you have simple file management just like most distributions, right? However, in the Linux world, they typically use 
  different file systems, than in Windows or Mac OS. So, in Windows you have the NTFS, the New Technology File System. In the Apple world you have 
  APFS, the Apple File System, or the older Mac OS, extended file system, which is called HFS Plus. Well, neither of those work in Linux. There's 
  ways to make them work but those are commercially licensed software, they're not free. And so Linux distros typically do not include them because 
  the Linux distributions are trying to maintain a level of freedom. So they use a different file system called EXT or the extended file system 
  which is different than the Mac OS extended so don't confuse those. But they use EXT. There's actually a handful of other file systems that can 
  be used in Linux, because again, it's about choice. So there's XSF, there is ZFS, there's a few other ones that are out there. They're not as 
  popular, BTRFS I guess is becoming a little more popular. They're not as popular, but it's up to you. If you want to use them, you can, you can 
  pick and choose. The default though for most Linux distributions is EXT and EXT gives you the ability to sort files and folders, what I'm looking 
  at here. <br><br>

  You can also do links and aliases. So it might look like you have a file but it's actually pointing to a file somewhere else, like a short cut. 
  You have that functionality. You can do compression and encryption. That's all functionality built into EXT. Well, all of that is hidden from us. 
  The end user, right? When we're in a graphical user interface, we don't see that. But it is actually being managed by the system. If I fire up 
  my Disks utility here, I can see that I've got a 275 GB disk. And that if I look at it this one is formatted Ext4, right? So this one has the 
  Ext4 file system it's been configured that way. They configured it for me, I just did a default to install it here so that's what they chose. 
  But there are other file systems that are available when you format a file system. I'm not gonna format this one because I'm running on it. 
  But when you format it, it actually lets you choose from different file systems. And, even as I say that, the GUI is only showing me one. But, 
  from the disk, you’ll actually see there’s a ton of them that are supported. <br><br>

  <h4>APP INSTALLATION</h4>

  Installing an application is probably the biggest difference between Linux and the other distros. In Windows and in MacOS, it's relatively 
  easy to install software. In Linux, it's actually pretty difficult. It's really difficult because each distro handles applications a 
  little bit differently. So, applications are installed one way under Fedora and a different way under Ubuntu. It varies from distro to 
  distro. Now, most of our Linux operating systems provide some kind of application store, and I can see I've got one right here Ubuntu software. 
  I can go into the store and I can download applications here. So, if I want a graphics editor, I can come in and I can search for it. Actually, 
  I'll just go to Graphics and Photography, and I can browse through and I can find Blender, which is 3D rendering software. The GNU image 
  manipulation program, which is like a Photoshop clone. I find these, and I can just click and choose to install for free, and it's done. <br><br>

  But where I get a challenge is not every software package is available here. I'm gonna have to go and download it from a vendor, and when 
  you download it from a vendor website, they may or may not support Linux. There's a lot of software companies out there that don't make Linux 
  software. Maybe I love Microsoft Office. Well, they make Microsoft Office for Windows, and they make it for macOS. They don't make it for 
  Linux. I don't have that choice, I can't get Microsoft Office. I can get a clone, something like OpenOffice, or LibreOffice, or one of those. 
  I can install that, in fact I probably have it by default, but let's come in here and just see what we've got under productivity. 
  And there's LibreOffice right there, so I can take LibreOffice and it's already installed. I have an office clone, but it's not the same as 
  actual Microsoft Office, which I may want or need. If that's true, if I have software that I absolutely need to type, an OS like Linux might 
  not be a good choice for me. <br><br>

  Or I might have to jump through hoops to get that third party software running here. Remember that Linux started as an operating system for 
  developers, not for regular people. And so sometimes when software is distributed, it's distributed source code and you have to compile it. 
  Well, if you're not a programmer, that is not an easy feat and there's a lot of things that can go wrong and problems that can happen. And if 
  you're a hobbyist or a tech enthusiast it's kind of fun. You work around that but if you're a regular end user it is not fun, it is not a good 
  experience, and that's why Linux has less than a 1% market share on user workstations. Across the entire world it is just not a popular 
  workstation OS. But let me tell you when it comes to servers and it's a different story. In this server world, well we want our servers to be 
  as optimized as possible, to run as fast as they can and Linux gives us the freedom to come in and eliminate. All the software that we don't 
  need and it get it very small, very efficient, and because it's a free operating system we can clone it over and over and over again to create 
  a server farm as big as we want without incurring licensing fees. <br><br>

  That's a big deal and that's why Linux does have a commanding market share in the server world. But remember, on a server you don't see a 
  graphical user interface. On a server It boots up, and you see a black screen, and a command prompt, and it sits there. Because you're supposed 
  to enable some services, and just let it run and not mess with the server again. Right, that's how servers function. So a very different world, 
  when you get into servers. And that is the world where Linux performs the best. When we talk about multitasking, operating systems have come a 
  long way. Well, in the Unix world, multi tasking was old hat. They've been doing it for a long time so it made sense that Linux would have that 
  functionality as well and it did. So I can come in here and I can have my terminal open, I can launch a web browser, I can fire up LibreOffice. 
  So I'm running all these different applications, all side by side. And they show up here in my side bar, so I can easily switch between them just 
  through on-screen elements, or I can use the Alt+Tab. Keyboard shortcut to switch in between them that way as well so I've got the ease of moving 
  around. <br><br>

  <h4>SYSTEM MONITOR</h4>

  There's an application in GNOME, so if you're using the different interface you may not have this, but in the gnome interface there is an 
  application called the system monitor. And if you fire up the system monitor it shows you the performance of your system, and the applications 
  that are running so I can see all the programs, how much CPU they're using, how much memory they're consuming and if I have a program that's 
  gone crazy like maybe Firefox goes crazy that I might see it in here at a 100% CPU I can take it and I can terminate that program. By stopping 
  it or killing it. Stopping it kind of pauses it, and sometimes you can retrieve your data, or I can just outright kill it, and that's going to 
  kill out Firefox, and my system stays up and running and happy. That's kind of the nice part of having a multitasking operating system, so you 
  can see all that activity that is going on in your system. And really get the most out of your computer. And this is very similar to the task 
  manager, and activity monitor from Windows and Mac OS.  <br><br>

  <h4>USER ACCOUNTS</h4>

  Linux had user accounts before any of the other operating systems. So Windows and Mac OS weren't designed as network operating systems from the 
  ground up. They were designed as stand alone systems, and then they added networking later on. Well, Linux was based upon Unix, which was a 
  network operating system from very, very early on. So, Linux has always been a network operating system. And a key component to being a network 
  operating system Is that you have more than one system, which means more than one user. So that user functionality is absolutely built in. 
  And when you install Linux, it's actually gonna create two user accounts for you. One user account is yours, regular user that you can use to 
  do things. And the second user account is a special one called root. And the root user is like a full administrative user, they can do whatever 
  they want on the computer. And if it's just you using the computer, that's probably all you'll have, you and root. But if you're sharing the 
  computer or if you're using it in a corporate environment, you'll want more than one user account. <br><br>

  And if I go into my application list here and just type users, I'll find inside of the settings panel where there is a users panel. And I can 
  come in and I can create additional user accounts. Now, when I look at it right now I just see myself and that's it. But that's because I'm 
  logged in as a regular user. If I hit the unlock button, it's going to ask me to authenticate as an administrator. And so I can provide 
  my password. And now, not only do I see my account, but I've got a nice, shiny add user button up here, and I can add more users. I can make 
  them standard users or administrators. This is kind of a key component of an operating system is the ability to give people that experience of 
  using their own environment so now when I go to log in, I get to pick which user I'm gonna log in as. So the key thing here is that, Linux, 
  while it might be free, while it might be developed by a large number of hobbyists and enthusiasts, it is actually a very viable operating system. 
  And in the server world it's already one, in the work station world we'll see. Each year they seem to get a little stronger and a little stronger 
  in their desktop presence but there's usually some application or another that people say I need this application and it doesn't run on Linux. 
  And so that's kind of what kills it and holds it back. <br><br>

  The video gaming industry is like that where most video games don't run on Linux and so video games oddly enough drive technology development, 
  and so that kind of holds Linux back. But we're seeing a lot of that change. And who knows, maybe when we fill the same show ten years from now, 
  we'll be talking about Linux as the primary workstation OS. Just, time will tell. <br><br>

  <h4>SUMMARY</h4>

  All right, all of these operating systems are fairly similar in the functionality they provide. If you're going to be an IT worker, I encourage 
  you to learn a little bit about all three of them. If you have Windows on your own machine, you've kinda knocked out one OS. Or if you have Mac 
  OS on your own machine, you've got that. If you wanna experiment with the others, though, you'll probably wanna learn a little bit about 
  virtualization. Programs like Virtual Box or VMWare Workstation, VMWare Fusion. Those programs, they let you run other operating systems in a 
  virtual machine, so you can quickly switch between them and practice and learn without messing up your underlying operating system. 
  Check that out, check out virtualization technology cuz it's a great way to learn OSs and experiment even if you're not quite sure. And Linux, 
  Linux is a steep learning curve. It's a hard one to jump in and learn. So you don't want to just format your machine, and go Linux on day one. 
  You want to kind of dip your toes in the water. Virtualization lets you do that. So definitely check it out if you want to learn more. <br><br>
