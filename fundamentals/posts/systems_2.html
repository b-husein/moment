  Now we will write couple of sentences about Microsoft Windows which is the most popular operating system in the world used by a 
  bulk of business users and most of the home users as well. We will focus on how it functions, what it does and 
  how it is different from other operating systems. <br><br>

  Windows was not the first operating system made by Microsoft, the first one was named DOS which was a command based OS designed 
  to run on some of the old IBM PCs. One of the things that made DOS so popular was that you could run it on different CPUs, so you
  would buy any computer and DOS, and install it without any issues. Downside is that it wasn’t that much user friendly (terminal use) 
  and you could run only one program at a time. <br><br>

  Over the years as computers became more advanced hardware has become much better and computer systems have developed quite a lot. 
  Back in the 80s Microsoft and IBM teamed up to work on an operating system called ‘OS2’ that had GUI (Graphical User Interface). 
  After they split up, that OS2 evolved in Microsoft Windows, but the core is still there, and we can launch it using Command Prompt 
  (cmd) and we will get the old DOS environment. <br><br>

  The name ‘Windows’ came from the look of Graphical User Interface (GUI), that reminds of windows on a house, if we look in one window, 
  we can see a living room, in the other one we can see kitchen etc. and more importantly we can run more than one program at the same time, 
  browsing the Internet, browsing through file system and many more things, which is called multitasking and that by default means that 
  Microsoft Windows is a multitasking operating system that allows computer to do more than one thing at time. <br><br>

  Microsoft Windows is heavily reliant on GUI, and part of the reason why is so popular is because it has been around for a long time, 
  and another reason is that we can buy MS Windows by itself, and also a custom hardware (Dell, HP, Acer, Lenovo etc.) that we can install 
  Windows on, so we have a flexibility of picking a hardware that we want. Other vendors like Apple don’t do that. You couldn’t buy macOS 
  just by itself, if you want this operating system, you would have to buy Apple hardware also. On the other hand, when software developers 
  write a program, they will write it for the most popular OS first, example - the Windows first, then Mac and Linux. <br><br>

  At the heart of the operating system is something called a <strong>kernel</strong>. It’s basically a very small application, hidden behind the user interface, 
  the first program that starts when the OS is launched and it’s doing all the real work. User interface is the way we use to interact with the 
  kernel, and the UI in MS Windows is called <strong>Explorer</strong>. We shouldn’t confuse it with the Internet Explorer browser. The explorer interface is 
  designed to allow easier user access to things on the system. When we look at our screen, desktop, we are looking at explorer which gives us 
  several very useful options. <br><br>

  Those options that explorer gives us are - icons on our desktop, and they are created with the idea of looking at actual desks and folders on them. 
  At the bottom of the screen we have a taskbar that has a Start button which allows us to access other areas of the system, and when we click on 
  it we get a Start Menu, with a list of all programs on our system and we can launch them from here. <br><br>

  Besides  this, when we click on the Start button we have a search functionality here that we can use to search for apps, documents and even the 
  web itself. In MS Windows that search is powered by something called Cortana which is designed to be user friendly with the goal of finding 
  information on our own system and online, and we can communicate with Cortana via voice. <br><br>

  From the Start we can also browse our file system. This is probably the number one task with most OS, the need to give you (as a user) an access to your files, 
  so every OS has some kind of file system browser, and MS Windows has one called <strong>File Explorer</strong>. If we launch it, it will show us 
  our file system, basically the most frequent stuff, files and folders we used recently. On the left we can click on <strong>This PC</strong> 
  and we can browse to our hard drives and access files stored there. <br><br>

  Now, when it comes to files, for example documents, in order to open or edit them we need some sort of additional application. So all we 
  need to do is double click on the document and it will open up in a word processor, by MS Windows default it’s Microsoft WordPad. When we 
  are just browsing through our system, a lot of things that are going on in the background are hidden from us because they are a bit complex 
  and this is where <strong>NTFS (New Technology File System)</strong> comes into play. <br><br>

  <strong>NTFS</strong> basically keeps track of where our files are, what permissions are on them etc. If we right click on This PC and we 
  click on Manage option, we can see the <strong>Computer Management</strong> screen. So, here we can click on <strong>Disk Management</strong> 
  and we can see that our disks have NTFS File System. So NTFS is what provides us with the ability to locate these files quickly, store them in 
  the way that we know it will maintain integrity, technically if we put a file there we know it will be the same file a year from now unless we 
  choose to modify it. It also provides us with some advanced functions like <strong>encryption</strong> or <strong>compression</strong>. If we 
  choose some file on our computer, it can be some document (.docx) file and we right click on it, select Advanced, we will see two options with 
  encryption or compression, we can choose only one. <br><br>
