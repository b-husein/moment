 Operating system (OS) is responsible for everything that occurs on the computer, it’s handling the interaction between user 
 and the hardware that user is using, basically a pivotal piece of how computers function, it’s the core 
 component that every computer must have in order to ‘operate’ or work. Some important questions are - what makes an 
 operating system, how OS works and what kind of operating systems we have out there. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Even though we are addressing our computers in English (for example, to open a web browser and type a word like ‘kitchen’, 
 and it shows us the output in the web browser), computers are ‘thinking’ in binary (zeros and ones). So, the operating 
 system is what is sitting in between user and computer, and basically translating user input into ones and zeros. OS is 
 listening to user input via keyboard, microphone, mouse etc. and it’s receiving that information, translating it into a 
 way that the computer can understand, and vice versa, getting the output from the computer and translating it into a way 
 that the user can understand it.
</p><br>

<p>
 Operating system does not work by itself, it also has certain applications (programs) that go with it, for example, 
 if we want to browse the internet, we need a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox). How do those programs know how to talk 
 to our hardware? They don’t, they know how to talk to our OS, and they leave the OS to talk to hardware. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Operating systems have evolved during years, in the past they were not that much user friendly, everything was based on 
 terminal and commands input, until they have become graphical, like the ones that we have and use today. Basically all 
 operating systems are giving us the same ability - to launch an application and then we can use it for personal or business 
 use or to achieve a task.
