<p>
 Operating system (OS) is responsible for everything that occurs on the computer, it’s handling the interaction between user 
 and the hardware that user is using, basically a pivotal piece of how computers function, it’s the core 
 component that every computer must have in order to ‘operate’ or work. Some important questions are - what makes an 
 operating system, how OS works and what kind of operating systems we have out there. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Even though we are addressing our computers in English (for example, to open a web browser and type a word like ‘kitchen’, 
 and it shows us the output in the web browser), computers are ‘thinking’ in binary (zeros and ones). So, the operating 
 system is what is sitting in between user and computer, and basically translating user input into ones and zeros. OS is 
 listening to user input via keyboard, microphone, mouse etc. and it’s receiving that information, translating it into a 
 way that the computer can understand, and vice versa, getting the output from the computer and translating it into a way 
 that the user can understand it.
</p><br>

<p>
 Operating system does not work by itself, it also has certain applications (programs) that go with it, for example, 
 if we want to browse the internet, we need a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox). How do those programs know how to talk 
 to our hardware? They don’t, they know how to talk to our OS, and they leave the OS to talk to hardware. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Operating systems have evolved during years, in the past they were not that much user friendly, everything was based on 
 terminal and commands input, until they have become graphical, like the ones that we have and use today. Basically all 
 operating systems are giving us the same ability - to launch an application and then we can use it for personal or business 
 use or to achieve a task.
</p><br>

<p>
 Computers were originally designed as tools, to perform certain tasks. Today we have different computers for work and gaming, 
 and today we have different computers for different purposes. So, operating systems are also with different purposes for different 
 things. If we are on the desktop, we are expecting a nice GUI (graphical user interface), but if we are on the server, the emphasis 
 there is on performance rather than looking user friendly and nice, without fancy animations. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Related to popular operating systems today, we have Windows, Mac and Linux. We have different variations related to operating systems, 
 in a desktop we expect to have different applications, but in other, more specialized operating systems, like the ones running inside 
 of web cameras and they are functioning more like a server, designed to interact with it remotely, differently than workstation operating 
 system that we would use and which is not designed for one specific task.
</p><br>

<p>
 By specializing for one single task, this webcam operating system we mentioned before can do it much faster, much more efficiently with 
 less hardware and that is called <strong>embedded firmware.</strong> It’s basically an operating system that is built right into the circuit board of this 
 camera. We cannot replace it, and again there is the difference with a workstation (like our PC) where we can replace our OS as we want it 
 or run multiple OS at the same time on one workstation. 
</p><br>

<p>
 In order to do that, we can use <strong>Hypervisor</strong> and that is a piece of software that lets us run more than one operating system on 
 top of a single piece of hardware. For example, it allows us to run Linux and Windows on Mac OS as a host system and similar. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Related to mobile phones, we also need to mention that they also have OS and they count as being embedded but modern smartphones are very 
 close to regular computers. The kernel, the key component in the operating system on our Android smartphone is actually the same as for Linux 
 Ubuntu desktop version, which means that Android phones are effectively running heavily customized Linux. 
</p><br>

<p>
 When we buy a computer, we buy a collection of hardware, like CPU, NIC, Sound, Disk, RAM. CPU or processor is extremely important, it’s basically 
 the brain of the computer. NIC or Network Interface Card is important for connecting to the Internet etc. All of this hardware needs to be handled 
 and we need to communicate with it. When we click on a browser, we are instructing the operating system to do something, in this case to launch an 
 app that is a web browser in order for us to fulfill a certain task. In the background, the instruction is sent to CPU, then it goes to Disk (HDD 
 or SSD) to find the web browser, copies it into RAM where it actually runs from and it displays it on the screen via our graphical card, and it's 
 listening for our mouse clicks or keyboard input etc. All of that is being managed by our OS. 
</p><br>

<p>
 On the other hand we have other OS like Microsoft Windows where we can buy a copy of the Windows by itself and then we can load it into the 
 computer without Windows having a clue about the hardware that is going to find there, so it has to be ready, to detect the hardware and figure 
 it out, and to do that it’s dealing with <strong>Hardware Abstraction Layer</strong> or <strong>HAL</strong> that is basically saying - we don’t want software to even think about 
 hardware. OS vendors (or manufacturers) work with hardware vendors to figure out what hardware is made in order to support it. The hardware vendors 
 will create <strong>drivers</strong> or special softwares that enables the operating system to talk to hardware. 
</p><br>

<p>
 For example, I have a really awesome NVidia Geforce graphic card, but the system doesn’t know it unless there is a NVidia driver there that will 
 enable the system to recognize the graphic card. There are two big advantages of this, first, it makes software development a lot easier. 
 Simplicity in a way that we have three main OS (Linux, Windows and Mac) and vendors understand that they need to make drivers specifically for 
 these systems. For example, if we want to download a software like Sublime text, when we go to the official website we can download it for Mac, 
 Windows or Linux. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Now, these were the basics or the primary ideas related to operating systems, but there are much more additional functions in operating systems 
 like power management, crash prevention and troubleshooting, data logging, permissions and access controls, software updates, network services 
 etc. and we will talk about them later on. For ITF+ we need to understand basic functions of operating systems.
