 Just to summarize, the whole purpose of the network is to get data from one place to another, 
 which means that data will be moved through network somehow. Now what comprises our networks?
 We have many different network components, in this case I'll mention 8 most important, like 
 clients, servers, hubs, WAP, switch, router, media and WAN link.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Client</strong> is a device used by an end-user to access the network with. It usually
 is something like PC, tablet, smartphone, smart TV or any other terminal device. Basically any 
 device that connects to a network.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Server</strong> is a device that provides resources to the rest of the network. We have
 differenbtn servers that provide different functions like: web server, email server, chat server, 
 print server and many more. These can be <strong>dedicated hardware</strong> or a <strong>specialized type
 of software</strong> that device uses.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Hub</strong> is an older piece of technology that connects network devices together (such as clients
 and servers). The problem with hubs was that they can lead to increased network errors, because hub receives 
 information in one port and rebroadcasts it out all the other ports. For example, if we have 51 port hub, when 
 one person is talking, the other 50 people have to listen to it too.
