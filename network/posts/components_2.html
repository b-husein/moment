<p>
 Just to summarize, the whole purpose of the network is to get data from one place to another, 
 which means that data will be moved through network somehow. Now what comprises our networks?
 We have many different network components, in this case I'll mention 8 most important, like 
 clients, servers, hubs, WAP, switch, router, media and WAN link.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Client</strong> is a device used by an end-user to access the network with. It usually
 is something like PC, tablet, smartphone, smart TV or any other terminal device. Basically any 
 device that connects to a network.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Server</strong> is a device that provides resources to the rest of the network. We have
 differenbtn servers that provide different functions like: web server, email server, chat server, 
 print server and many more. These can be <strong>dedicated hardware</strong> or a <strong>specialized type
 of software</strong> that device uses.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Hub</strong> is an older piece of technology that connects network devices together (such as clients
 and servers). The problem with hubs was that they can lead to increased network errors, because hub receives 
 information in one port and rebroadcasts it out all the other ports. For example, if we have 51 port hub, when 
 one person is talking, the other 50 people have to listen to it too. Switches, that we are using today, are 
 actually the second generation version of hubs, that combine hubs with another device called a bridge. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>WAP</strong> (Wireless Access Point) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired
 network. Example with smartphone that is connecting to wifi, as a matter of fact it is connecting to WAP, which
 is basically used everywhere nowadays. A WAP acts like a wireless hub, whatever is broadcasted one way, it goes
 the other way as well. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Switch</strong> is a device that connects network devices together (like a next generation version hub), 
 just like hub did, but there is a big difference here, switches can learn which devices are on which ports. Instead
 of listening for one port and pushing other ports out, a switch will take it on port one and then send it out to port
 two, three or four, and this is a big benefit of a switch. Switches are only going to forward traffic received from one
 port to the destination ports, and that's why we call them 'smart hubs'. Besides more efficiency, they provide us with
 more security than hubs.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Router</strong> is a device that connects two different networks together and intelligently forwards traffic
 to and from a network based on tis logical address, which we refer to as an IP address, or Internet Protocol address. 
 Modern routers use IP addresses to determine the routing of network traffic. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Media</strong> connects two devices or a device to a switch port and is made from copper cable, fiber optic
 cable, or radio frequency waves if we are using wifi. Media is the thing that connects everything. Each type of media
 has its own strengths and limitations, example copper is very cheap to use, but it can't go very far. Fiber optic can 
 go very far, but it costs a lot of money, there are also other things like bandwidth limitations, capacity limitations
 and distance limitations.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>WAN</strong> (Wide Area Network) link physically connects two geographically dispersed networks together. The
 Internet is really just a big series of WAN links. For example, if we could connect to our home network and we wouldn't 
 have WAN link, we would only be able to talk inside of our house, without connection to outside world, like social networks
 or search engines and similar. WAN link is our connection to the outside world, it connects our internal network with external
 networks.
