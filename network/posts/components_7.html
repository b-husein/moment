  <strong>IoT or Internet of Things</strong> is literally everything. It's everything from smart home appliances to servers,
  laptops and work stations. What we actually need is to understand some of the technologies used by these IoT devices. So what
  are some specific Internet of Things technologies?
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>802.11</strong> - is one of them, and of course 802.11 stands for WiFi. If we have IoT device like wireless speaker 
  or a refrigerator they can use that WiFi to make connections back to the outside world. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Bluetooth</strong> - is another one, for example, our keys can have bluetooth receiver in them to find them with our 
 phone if we lose them. This allows it to be a part of this mesh network as well, so our keys can talk to our cellphone via Bluetooth,
 and then your cellphone can connect over cellular to tell you where those keys are. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>RFID</strong> stands for Radio Frequency ID; it uses electromagnetic fields to read data stored in embedded tags. A good example
 of it is a hotel room key. This key has a chip embedded in it and it uses an electromagnetic field that when you put it next to the door lock
 it reads the tag in the key and lets you in the room. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>NFC - Near Field Communication</strong> enables two electronic devices to communicate within a 4 cm range. Samsung is one of the first
 to use NFC for Samsung Pay. 
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>IR - Infrared</strong> technology operates within line of sight. For example TV remote that we have at home uses infrared frequency, 
  because it has a line of sight using an infrared frequency and it uses these light beams to tell the TV which channel you want. 
</p>

<p>
 Next two technologies are very common nowadays, and we can say that they are relatively new.
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>Z-Wave</strong> provides short-range, low-latency data transfer with slower rates and less power consumption than WiFi, but again,
  we are trading off lower speed because we are getting lower power consumption. WiFi can burn up our battery pretty quickly and for IoT devices, 
  we try to save battery whenever possible. Z-Wave is primarily used for home automation, things like turning lights on and off or turning sound
  on and off. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>ANT+</strong> is another technology we have, and this is going to be a collection of transfer of sensory data. For example a tire pressure
 system in our car, it might be using ANT+; It can also be used with remote control systems, things like tire pressures, TVs, lights etc. so we can
 know what things are on and what things are off. Anything with a sensor in it is usually going to be something that's using ANT+. 
</p><br>

<p>
 It's important to remember that if we are thinking more of sensors and collecting the temperature or how bright something is, that's usually
 more of an ANT+ thing, and Z-Wave will be refering to things like home automation. So when we look at IoT, when we look at all of these devices, 
 and how they are connecting to our networks, and from a security standpoint that is very risky. On of the outgoing jokes in IT community is 
 "The 'S' in IoT stands for 'security' ...", but nevertheless we cannot ignore the fact that these devices are extremely useful.

 In the next post, I will write about OSI model.
