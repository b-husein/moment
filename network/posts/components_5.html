 When we talk about <strong>network topology</strong>, we can talk about it in two ways. The first is <strong>physical</strong>
 and how devices are connected or cabled together by media, and second is <strong>logically</strong> and how the actuall network
 traffic flows. Now what matters here is to know that there is a difference between physical and logical topology, and that difference
 is that one is focused on the logical or network flow and other on the physical layout of the cable. So, what are some of the options
 we have for different topologies?
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Bus Topology</strong> is a topology where single cable running through an area that requires network connectivity amd each 
 device 'taps' into the cable using either a T-connector or a vampire tap. This is an old technology but we still do have some Bus topologies
 out there. If we see a bus topology, we need to have in mind that all the devices on this cable would form 'a single collision domain', this 
 means that if all connected devices would try to talk at the same time, we would have a collision because they all are connected to the same 
 cable, and in other to avoid that they would have to take turns. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Ring Topology</strong> uses a cable running in a circular loop and each device is connected to the ring with data traveling in a 
 singular direction. Data would travel clockwise or counter-clockwise depending of the configuration of the network. In order to overcome 
 the collision we've had a <strong>token ring</strong>; This token ring was just a ring topology that uses an electronic token to prevent
 collisions by requiring a device to hold the 'token' when communicating on the network. This would allow computers to take turns. These rings
 were vulnerable to being broken, if we cut the cable it would take down the network.  
</p><br>

<p>
 Now, there is something known as <strong>FDDI</strong> which is Fiber network. The FDDI ring actually uses two counter-rotating rings for 
 redundancy, one on top of the another. One operates in clockwise direction, the other one in counter-clockwise direction. Redundancy means
 - if one of the rings is broken, the other one will take the network load. For Network+ exam it's important to note that if we see the word 
 'ring' we need to have in mind the FDDI ring; because modern ring networks are usually FDDI networks. Have in mind ring = redundancy. We can 
 get some sort of questions like which of these topologies is redundant, and then we will have options like star, bus and ring, and the answer 
 is going to be - a ring. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Star Topology</strong> is the most popular physical LAN topology where devices connect to a single centralized point or device, 
 which can be a switch, and this is how most of our networks look like nowadays. We can use it with fiber, copper or wireless if we want it,
 and it will use star topology. The problem with star topology is that we have one central device and if the central device fails, the entire
 network fails, because it's the 'single point of failure'. Even though these are very common to use and very expensive to use, they still have
 this vulnerability called 'a single point of failure'. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Hub-and-Spoke Topology</strong> tries to overcome 'single point of failure', it's similar to Star topology, but with WAN links instead
 of LAN connections and it is used for connecting multiple sites. It's not redundant because if one hub fails, we can loose large portions of 
 the network. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Full-Mesh Topology</strong> is a way to go if we are looking for a full redundancy. It's the most redundant topology where every node
 connects to every other node and optimal routing between nodes is always available. It works really well if you have a small network. Optimal
 routing is always available. The bad side of this is very large number of connections, it's very expensive to maintain and operate. The example
 that we have on six machines in this topology, to calculate the number of connections: <br>

  <code>
    x = n(n-1)/2 <br>
    x = 6(6-1)/2 <br>
    x = 15
  </code>
</p><br>

<p>
 So, for 6 machines it's going to take 15 cables to connect. If we have more machines, like 10 or 15, it will be messy, so this is 
 why we don't see Full-Mesh Topology in a physical network, instead we will see it often as a logical network. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Partial-Mesh Topology</strong> is often used in our business networks and it's a hybrid of the full-mesh and hub-and-spoke topologies.
 It provides an optimal routes between some sites, while avoiding the expense of connecting every site. It gives us additional redundancy we 
 need. To get it right, we need to understand traffic patterns and know where to put those main hubs and basically it then becomes modified
 Hub-and-Spoke, we have more hubs then we did before which allows us to have better redundancy in single Hub-and-Spoke configuration.

 In the next post, I will write about wireless network topology.
