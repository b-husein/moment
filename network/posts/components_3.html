<p>
 When we talk about network resources, we need to take into consideration how data is being moved around
 the network. We have two main models when it comes to this - Client/Server Model and Peer-to-Peer Model.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Client/Server Model</strong> uses dedicated server to provide access to files, scanner, printers and other
 resources on the network. The advantages of this model are <strong>easier administration and backup</strong>, because
 we have one central machine - the server that all the resources are sitting on, which makes Client/Server Model one of the 
 main choices we use in business networks. Other benefits are <strong>centralized administration</strong> (one or few key
 servers where we can focus our efforts), easier management, better scalability. Some drawbacks are that it costs more 
 money because it requires dedicated hardware, specialized OS, and also requires dedicated resources. Besides that, 
 Client/Server Model is still leading model we use in business networks.  
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Peer-to-Peer Model</strong> is a model where peers like laptops and desktops can share resources together directly.
 The administration and backup is difficult, because all the files are located on different machines in different places.
 There are situations where peer-to-peer is useful, for example when each person that is a part of the network can give
 and receive files, <strong>low cost</strong> because there is no infrastructure, <strong>no specialized hardware</strong>,
 no dedicated resources, or specialized OS. Some drawbacks of this model are - if one machine is off, then we cannot access files
 stored on it, but the biggest drawback is <strong>decentralized management</strong> where everyone can control and own
 their own machine and decide what they are sharing and what they're not sharing. This becomes inefficient for large networks
 and it has poor scalability. 
</p><br>

<p>
 It's important to remember that all the benefits for Client/Server Model are drawbacks for Peer-to-Peer Model, and all 
 the drawbacks on Client/Server Model are benefits on Peer-to-Peer Model. They are opposites of each other.
