  5. After this the web server returns a <strong>RESPONSE</strong>, just like our web browser has sent http based request, 
  now server returns http based response in a form of text data separated in three blocks. 
</p><br>

<p>
  <code>
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK <br>
    Content-Length: 88 <br>
    Content-Type: text/html <br>
    Connection: Closed
  </code>
</p><br>

<p>
  first line is status line that contains http version and http status code. In our case it contains 200 which is generic 
  response for a successful http request. Below that, in other three lines we have multiple headers defined as key value pairs. 
  Content-Type is very important here and it tells browser what to expect, in our case it is text/html or text content. 
  Now, instead of html file, if this is an API response, the content might be shown as Content-Type: application/json, 
  and in that case the response body would contain some JSON data for our application to consume, or in another case Content-Type: 
  image/jpeg for images etc.
</p><br>

<p>
  Content returned by web server is not limited just to web pages. The body of http response can contain images, pdf documents, 
  videos, JS code, web fonts (like Google fonts) etc.
</p><br>

<p>
  6. The big question is - how web server decides what to respond with? In practical sense, if we requested an image resource and web 
  server returns it, where is that web server getting an image from, how do we set this up in the real world? Determining which <strong>RESOURCE</strong> 
  to return is often refered to as routing - which is actually just a practice of connecting the request with requested resource or content. 
  Routing can be separated into two distinct categories: 
</p><br>

<p>
  a) Static routing - web server serving files out of a folder, just like when we have a folder on our desktop we can navigate to and open random stuff stored in 
  this folder. Similarly, we can point web server to a directory of a file that we need and tell it to return to us. For example this blog that you're reading 
  right now is a static page that is hosted on GitHub pages, and whenever we open the link https://b-husein.github.io/moment/ the GitHub 
  will return index.html hosted on its server.
</p><br>

<p>
  b) Dynamic routing - is specific to dynamic change of content, for example on Facebook when we have a lot of different people logging to their profile 
  at the same time, and web server must respond with different types of files etc. Now we would save all of this content into a database, and serve that 
  content dinamically. In practice, this usually means configuring your web server to route all requests to a single file or executable which serves 
  as an entry point for your web app. 
</p><br>

<p>
  Our web app would evaluate http request and then dinamically prepare a response depending on a requested resource. For example with a e-commerce 
  site we've had previously when we wrote about GET request, it contains 
</p><br>

<p>
  <code>
    GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1
  </code>
</p><br>

<p>
  and when we send this request to web app it would search the database for order 123 and return a status. And this was a basic 
  overview of what server does and how it works. 
</p><br>
