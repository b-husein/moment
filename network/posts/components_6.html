  Previously I wrote about different physical and logical topologies. All of those logical ones can still be 
  applied to our <strong>wireless networks</strong>, but when we talk about them from a physical perspective, wireless does add 
  two different modes that we need to understand. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Infrastructure mode</strong> is the first mode that uses a wireless access point as a centralized point (like a star) and
 supports wireless security controls and centralized management, that we don't get when we use Ad Hoc, our second mode.
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>Ad Hoc mode</strong> is basically a second mode that represents decentralized wireless network which creates peer-to-peer 
  connections and doesn't require a router or an access point. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Wireless Mesh Topology</strong> is the third type that represents interconnection of different types of nodes, devices or radios
 which consists of clients, routers, gateways and other devices, so basically we're going to mesh them all together and create this unique 
 network. This gives us redundant and reliable connections as we move forward, especially in hars environments. Where we might use Wireless 
 Mesh Topology? Well, after there's a hurricane or another disaster related event, people will use different types of network to communicate
 like cellular, satellite, wireless, microwave etc. Now as we have all of these different connections working together, it gives us our mesh 
 topology. 
</p><br>

<p>
 In the next post, I will write about IoT or Internet of Things.
