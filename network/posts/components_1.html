 In this post I will write about networks and their basic components. First of all we need to have in mind that 
 the basic purpose of the network is to actually make connections between machines. Long time ago we had different 
 networks for different purposes, but over time those networks have merged and converged and now we have voice, video 
 and data, all travelling over the same network. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>Converged network</strong> combines multiple types of traffic like data, video, and voice in a single network. 
 For example, when we are using our PC, it actually does not care if we are making a video call, sending a text, video or
 another type of data through the network. 
</p><br>

<p>
 Because we are so dependant on networks, we are expecting <strong>high availability</strong> because of our work and communication.
 People expect 100% of uptime, meaning the network should not be down at any time. Realistically we cannot achieve that, there will 
 always be certain amount of downtime. But, in our business networks, we now have come to expect a <strong>99.999</strong> percent 
 uptime. This is what we call the <strong>"five nines of availability"</strong>, which basically means only 5 minutes of downtime 
 allowed per year. That is the challenge we face as network technicians, we've got to keep those networks up and data flowing.
</p><br>

<p>
 Now that we know that our primary goal is to keep networks up, what kind of network traffic can we expect to see within our networks?
 There are different types of network traffic like: file sharing, video chatting, web surfing, social media, video streaming, email, 
 messaging, VoIP (Voice over IP). As network technicians, we are going to be expected to support them, which is a big struggle,
 especially if we want to maintain those "five nines of availability".
