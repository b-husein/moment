  What is a web server? When I started learning about servers, one basic question that I've had was how server
  hardware is different than the hardware of PCs that I've built and used in past. In this case, I think 
  that I was asking the wrong question. From a hardware standpoint, anything with a connection can be a server, 
  personal computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi, smartphone, any IoT device and similar.
</p><br>

<p>
  Web server is not about hardware, though some hardware is better suited to run large web apps, instead of 
  web server is basically just a block of code that serves web content. There are six basic things that server does 
  in order to serve web content: 
</p><br>

<ol>
  <li>
    LISTENS 
  </li>
  <li>
    on a PORT
  </li>
  <li>
    for a REQUEST
  </li>
  <li>
    sent via TRANSPORT PROTOCOL
  </li>
  <li>
    returns a RESPONSE
  </li>
  <li>
    containing the requested RESOURCE
  </li>
</ol><br>

<p>
  Now let's have a closer look at each of these items.
</p>

<p>
  1. What it means for a web server to <strong>listen?</strong>
  When web server app starts up, it doesn't do anything until it receives an incoming request, 
  until then the web server does not do anything. What exactly is the web server listening to? 
</p><br>

<p>
  2. The answer is <strong>the network port</strong> provided by operating system that the web server is running on (Linux, Windows, MacOS); 
  For example we can configure that port to be 8080, if we are running our server locally, we will use 
  link http://localhost:8080;
</p><br>

<p>
  so here we are using unencrypted http connection, and in most cases, it's not necessary to specify the port, because the web browser 
  will automatically route our request to port 80  by default. The point is that one signe computer can have many web servers running 
  at the same time but listening on different ports. Our request must be sent to the correct port in order to reach the desired web server. 
</p><br>

<p>
  3. What does it means <strong>to send a REQUEST</strong> to a web server? Web servers and web clients (like our web browsers) communicate via HyperText 
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and we can think of this as the language that web server and web client use. But what is HTTP actually look like?
</p><br>

<p>
  The HyperText in HTTP literally means text. It's just a human-readable text that web servers and clients exchange back and forth.  
  The example of HTTP request:
</p><br>

<p>
  <code>
    GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1 <br>
    Host: 127.0.0.1:8080 <br>
    User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request
  </code>
</p><br>

<p>
  And we can see a valid request in HTTP language. The first line is the start line which contains the request method, in this case it's GET, 
  the request target or resource /orders/123 - for example an order on e-commerce website, and finally the HTTP version, which in our case is 
  HTTP/1.1
</p><br>

<p>
  Next two lines represent headers of our request as defined as key value pairs. On the line two, we have two of them - Host, which is the IP 
  and port we are attempting to send our request to, and on the third line is the User-Agent which tells server what type of browser we are 
  using, for example if we are sending request on mobile device, the server will serve us mobile content in that case. And usually after these 
  three lines, we will have first line break.
</p><br>

<p>
  Another block that we cannot see up there can contain optional body that starts after the first line break at the end of our header block; 
  since we are looking at GET request up there, we actually don't have a body, but for example, let's suppose that we have submitted a 
  form to server via POST request that looks like this:
</p><br>

<p>
  <code>
    POST /orders HTTP/1.1 <br>
    Host: 127.0.0.1:8000 <br>
    User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request <br>
    Content-Length: 12 <br>
    Content-Type: application/x-www <br>
    order_id=123
  </code>
</p><br>

<p>
  This is the HTTP protocol itself. It's considered to be an Application Protocol, like the language that web server and web client speak. 
  If any other AP other than HTTP is sent to our web server it will not know how to handle it, for example FTP or File Transfer Protocol 
  that is typically used to transfer files. 
</p><br>

<p>
  Now if we started FTP server, it begins listening for requests sent in the File Transfer Protocol, which is a different language that 
  HyperText Transfer Protocol that web servers and web browsers speak. If we send HTTP request to FTP server, we would get invalid response 
  error because FTP server would not understand the request. 
</p><br>

<p>
  4. Now, how is the HTTP request actually sent to a web server? We know that HTTP and FTP are Application Layer Protocols which means that 
  they both run on the top of the <strong>TRANSPORT</strong> layer protocol which is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which (very simplified definition) 
  breaks data into packets, then using handshake and confirmations it ensures that every packet is successfully received by the receipient, 
  and the receipient knows the order of each packet for the reassembly. 
</p><br>

<p>
  5. After this the web server returns a <strong>RESPONSE.</strong>
