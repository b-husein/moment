 Previously, we talked how we share data, regardless of using Client/Server Model or Peer-to-Peer Model, but we didn't talked
 about the distance we can share it across. And that will be the topic of network geography. In this part we will start with 
 smallest networks and work our way up to the largest networks.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>(PAN) - Personal Area Network</strong> is the smallest type of wired or wireless network and covers the least amount 
 of area (only few meters). The example of PAN are bluetooth and USB. Bluetooth is great example, if we turn it on while in our car
 and it starts transmitting music from the phone wirelessly to our radio in the car, we have a great example of Personal Area Network,
 because we have a connection of our car radio with our phone. Another great example is external hard drive that is connected with our 
 PC or laptop, and this type of connection is considered as serial connection, but it's also a PAN connection. PAN distance is no 
 longer than <strong>3 meters.</strong>
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>(LAN) - Local Area Network</strong> connects components within a limited distance, generally <strong>up to a 100 meters.</strong>
 Each segment can go up to a 100 meters if we are using CAT 5 cabling, but if we are using fiber optic cabling we can go further. The best
 way to think about LAN is to think about it as a small office or one floor of an office building.
</p><br>

<p>
 It's also important to note that our networks can be consisting of Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) or WiFi (IEEE 802.11), depending on how do we 
 want to set them up. If we are using Ethernet, we will use IEEE 802.3 standard, but if we are using WiFi we will use IEEE 802.11 standard.
</p><br>

<p>
 Now, what are some examples of the LAN? The internal wired or wireless network in your office building or school, classroom, are all Local
 area network connections. For example, all of our devices at home, attached to network make our own LAN. 
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>(CAN) - Campus Area Network</strong> connects building-centric LANs across a university, industrial park, or business park and 
 covers many square miles and buildings. This can cover up to a few miles area and across many different buildings. So, no matter at which
 building we are, every building has its own LAN that we connect to, but then those LANs are connected together to form this campus area network.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>(MAN) - Metropolitan Area Network</strong> connects scattered locations across a city or metro area. It's larger than Campus 
 Area Network but smaller than a global Wide Area Network. It can cover area up to 25 miles or one city. For example several Campus Area 
 Networks can be connected together to form Metropolitan Area Network.
</p><br>

<p>
 <strong>(WAN) - Wide Area Network</strong> connects geographically-disparate internal networks and consists of leased lines or Virtual
 Private Networks tunneled over the Internet. WAN covers a large geographic area, it has worldwide coverage. We actually look at the Internet
 as WAN, in fact it is the largest WAN available.
</p><br>

<p>
 Another important thing to think about when we talk about WAN is the fact that they always don't have to be public like the Internet is.
 An example is the company that has an office in NY and office in LA. Now, both of these locations have their own LANs, but if we want
 to connect them together over a private intranet, we can do that using a WAN connection. We will have those two LANs tied over this larger
 WAN link. Great example of this is USA government with offices all over the country, and all of those can be connected through a private 
 Wide Area Network connection.
</p><br>

<p>
 In summary, when we look at Network Geography, it's important to remember a distance involved;

  <ol>
    <li>
      PAN - Personal Area Network - around a person
    </li>

    <li>
      LAN - Local Area Network - around room or building
    </li>

    <li>
      CAN - Campus Area Network - around campus or business park
    </li>

    <li>
      MAN - Metropolitan Area Network - around city or county
    </li>

    <li>
      WAN - Wide Area Network - around country or worldwide
    </li>
  </ol>

 In the next post, I will write about wired network topology.
