  <h1 class="post-page-title">About stoicism (I).</h1>

<p>
  By reading about stoicism from Ryan Holiday and others, I learned about several insights that really helped me 
  out in extremely tough moments, and besides that to develop my mental resilience. No, stoicism is not some 
  'new age' and religion dogma, or self-help method taught by Tony Robbins, but it's a branch of philosophy created for those 
  of us who live our lives in the real world. My personal opinion is that most of the things that self-help gurus 
  sell nowadays are derived from stoicism and refactored to actually appeal the masses, leaving out the harsh truth 
  that no matter how hard you try, you will never achieve everlasting happiness, only brief satisfaction in the moment 
  that we call 'now'.
</p><br>

<p>
  <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> 
  talks about 'the doctrines of the Stoics (...) who define philosophy as a 
  kind of practice or exercise (askesis) in the expertise concerning what is beneficial. Once we come to know what 
  we and the world around us are really like, and especially the nature of value, we will be utterly transformed.'
</p><br>

<p>
  Stoicism is a school of thought founded by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. Simplified definition would be - a 
  philosophy that is almost 2300 years old and makes us more resilient, satisfied, more content, virtuous and wise. 
  As indirect result of practicing stoicism, we become better people and professionals. It's important to note that stoicism 
  has been integral part of life for many great rulers (Marcus Aurelius), presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson), 
  entrepreneurs (Patrick Bet-David), artists, writers and leaders in all fields who, influenced by stoicism, were remembered by history as exceptional people.

<p>
  I developed strong interest in stoicism because it's a philosophy of personal ethics that consists of its own system of logic 
  and its views on the natural world, and it all started when I read <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html
  " target="_blank">'Meditations'</a> by Marcus Aurelius, who was considered to be 
  'The Last Good Emperor' of the Roman Empire, and the most powerful man on earth at his own time. One of the things he did was 
  sitting down each evening and writing in his private diary, reflecting on the day that has passed. This private diary has been 
  published as 'The Meditations' that is, without any doubt, the most influential stoic book.

<p>
  In the next couple of paragraphs I will write about several maxims that deeply resonate with me, and I would like to leave 
  them here as a reference for myself and everyone that actually needs some good advice from time to time.
