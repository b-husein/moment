  This is the second part of the post that contains 5 brief points about learning process.
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>Identify your most important task, and do it first (MIT).</strong> Break down your MIT. What domino can I tip over
  today that will lean on the next one? And then we have to get that discipline of scheduling time to work on our
  MIT first thing in the morning. We are at our cognitive best for 2 hour window time in the morning.
</p><br>


<p>
  <strong>Control your inbox.</strong> All of those people, companies etc., want our attention, which is OK but it will get in the
  way of our productivity. So the bottom line is shut off the notifications on your phone and everything else. It’s OK
  to open social media apps, but do it when you want to do it – intentionally, not because someone else is calling
  you. The idea is to be intentional about it, and to be aware how much time we waste on social media. 
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>Work from your (Google) calendar, not a to-do list.</strong> Have in mind that 41% of items that people put on 
  their to-do lists are never done at all. A to-do list is the graveyard of important but not urgent. 
  If you really want something done, pick a day, time and duration
  and then work only on obligations from your calendar. Productivity is about energy and focus, not time. 
  We all have 1440 minutes in a day. It’s not about managing time it's about managing your energy, focus and attention. 
  The idea is to understand that we are limited with these three resources, no matter what some guru's say that we are unlimited 
  and similar. In terms of productivity, as Marty Lobdell says, we are designed to sprint and rest, sprint and rest. 
  For example, 25 minutes of work with 5 minutes rest, single tasking is also very important.
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>Say ‘no’ to everything that doesn’t support your immediate goals.</strong> We need to have in mind that people
  are not being rude when they say ‘no’, because their calendar and life is built around the things that will get them 
  to their goals. That doesn’t leave time for any other things. Every time we
  say ‘yes’ to something, we are actually saying ‘no’ to another thing. The trouble is when you want to be liked
  and you will say ‘yes’ to many people all the time and you will ignore your own schedule, pay attention to that.
  Get good with saying ‘no’ in a polite way. 
</p><br>

<p>
  <strong>Time is your most valuable and scarcest resource.</strong> We all have 1440 minutes in a single day. And we need to
  speak in minutes regarding the value of a time. Every minute is valuable. There is a certain number of minutes
  every single day that we have at our disposal, and we need to minimize wasted minutes. So if you start to capitalize
  at the time that you have, you’ll realize how much you can get done. If there is only one takeaway from this post, I would 
  definitely say - organize your priorities (no more than 3), schedule them (using calendar) and work on them on daily basis.
  Again, remember that your time, energy and attention are limited resource. Make sure to stay focused and work only on your 
  priorities.
