  Instead of writing long post about learning, I will break this topic into three different posts that are first of all note to self,
  and hopefully in the future somebody else can find them useful to create his own learning system. This post was inspired by 
  Marty Lobdell and his video lecture on 'Study Less, Study Smart' that I watched couple of years ago, before I even started learning 
  coding and computer science. Below are some most valuable notes I have taken, and also a link for his YouTube lecture video.
</p><br>

<p>
  The time we spend learning effectively is 25 minutes in total. After that we need to take a short break of 5 minutes to
  do something other than learning. If we do this in the course of 6 hours, 
  we will get about 5.5 hours of serious studying and half an hour of break time. 
  After those 6 hours of studying you want to give yourself a big treat. Whenever your studying time is 
  over – plan something special.
</p><br>

<p>
  Find the proper time to study. If you plan your day right, you can have those study breaks, and the coolest part
  is this – because you’re now reinforcing it with those little breaks doing something fun – you extend it, and we
  will find that we can go 30 - 50 minutes, or an hour without break. In his video 
  Marty also mentioned 'true study' concept, basically a room where we are only learning or studying, not doing anything 
  else. I think this is a non-sense because for me personally it's only important to have a room where I can be distraction
  free and focused on what I am learning. 
</p><br>

<p>
  The more active you are with your learning the more effective it will be. First decide what you are learning – is it
  a concept or a fact? A fact is a discrete little piece of information, example 5 = 5 is a fact, but understanding
  what is 5 is a concept. Or understanding the name of the bone is a fact, but understanding what it does in a
  body is a concept. It’s important to grasp a concept and once we do it it will stay with us for a lifetime. If you
  understand the concept you can quickly Google the fact if you need it. Break down the facts to understandable
  concepts.
</p><br>

<p>
  Take notes. Highlight or write down the most important thing, it's a waste of time to write everything. How do
  you know that you know something? If you look at it, go to the next one and read it, and then stop and go back
  to the one before – look up in the sky and then in your own words say what that was about, if you succeed, you
  can be sure that you know it.
</p><br>

<p>
  Taking notes is vital, we need to have in mind one simple rule – right after the class expand on everything that
  you jotted down during the class, give it depth, flesh it out. If you decide to do it a couple of hours after the
  lecture, you will forget most of the notes you’ve made. The best way to learn something is to teach it to
  someone else. Also, sleep is very much important. Around 8 hours is enough to get the REM that we need in order to memorize
  what we studied, or our permanent memories.
