<p>
  This page is dedicated to physical and mental health. Our lifestyle affects how long and how happy we live. 
  Besides that, our health impacts everyone around us including people we care about. Our bodies and minds are 
  built to live in a tribe in 50,000BC which leaves modern humans with a number of unfortunate traits (fixation 
  with tribal-style social survival, attracted to energy dense food, herd mentality etc.).
</p><br>

<p>
 There is only one way to get healtier, and more importantly stay healthy, by accumulating significant, 
 but livable, improvements to your lifestyle over time, and building on that. Although time is the ultimate 
 resource, the lack of energy will always be the first limiting factor. Therefore prioritizing health, sleep, 
 exercise, and other such aspects will always pay off far more than what you sacrifice on them.
</p><br>

<p>
 Getting healtier can mean getting better at managing difficult parts of our own genetic profile, and those 
 lessons can be handed on to future generations who share those traits, which improves the lives of all 
 the generations downstream.
