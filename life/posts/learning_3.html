The third part of the post is related to learning from tutorials. It's crucial for people entering CS field, and also
as note to self because I often tend to stuck in 'tutorial hell', in other words, start learning something
new and leave it because something else has caught my attention. We all been there. In order to avoid tis 
problem, we should understand couple of things.
</p><br>

<p>
First, we need to know our 'why'. What is the purpose of tutorial and our expectations from it? What
are we going to learn from it, and where can we apply the knowledge later? After answering these questions we 
will get clear picture about it, and it will not be hard for us to finish it because our 'why' is actually our 
motivation.
</p><br>

<p>
Second, add something of our own to tutorial projects, or if we want to go to the next level - make something
of our own. Creating something by writing our own code is a master level because it shows that we understand 
how to use the code in practical way. It's always easier to modify code written (or already modified) by other
programmers, but creating something of your own is whole another level.
</p><br>

<p>
Third, it's important to study documentation and go through the tutorial after that, or read an article or a book 
related to language you're already learning. After that we will be able to create something on our own, to 
write code with understanding of the concepts behind it.
</p><br>

<p>
Fourth, tutorials will give us conceptual knowledge related to some topic, but only way to actually learn something is 
by doing, practicing, learning from trial and error. If we are forced to use the knowledge, it's going to be hard
and we will struggle from time to time, but it will get easier because we will know where to look for the 
solution next time (StackOverflow, of course).
</p><br>

<p>
Summa summarum, previous three posts are related to my learning process that, as everything else, evolves through time 
as I'm learning new and different, more productive concepts along the way.
