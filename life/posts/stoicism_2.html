  <h1 class="post-page-title">About stoicism (II).</h1>
  <p class="post-meta-data">by Husein</p>

<p>
  Stoicism is trying to teach us that the only thing we can 
  actually control is our own thoughts, in other words ourselves, and our reactions to external stimulus. 
</p><br>

<p>
  In order to thrive, we should set realistic expectations and know that our life will have trials and a lot of things that can, 
  and will go wrong. We must accept that unpredictable things, good or bad are going to happen. 
</p><br>

<p>
  In every situation, we need to be present-minded, focused on the present moment. Most people are overwhelmed with thinking about 
  the past or the future and that leads to missing out of opportunities on the moment. Live in the moment.
</p><br>

<p>
  While living in the moment, we should free ourselves from the external and our happiness should not depend on external factors. 
  I must add that our happiness should not also depend on other people, 
  but that would require some psychological elaboration that would direct post from stoicism. The way of the stoic is to be free from the external.
</p><br>

<p>
  Nowadays, we can notice that a lot of people are actually practicing lifestyle like they will live forever. Acceptance 
  that everything will end (memento mori) is one of the key pillars of stoicism. Acceptance that we are all going to pass 
  away and leave this world at one moment. I would conclude that death makes this world (materialistic) so much miserable. 
  We should focus on being content with as much as we need, instead of chasing fog (material possessions) that we will leave 
  in couple of days, months, years or (if we are lucky enough) decades later.
</p><br>

<p>
  Ancient stoics practiced courage over fearlessness. For example, if we are experiencing fear of something on regular basis, 
  or we are worrying a lot, what we need is courage to do what scares us as many times as possible, all the way until it has 
  no effect on us anymore, and as a result we will become more fearless and confident.  
</p><br>

<p>
  Besides 'memento mori', another thing that really resonates with me is not depending on external (materialistic) in a way that it 
  becomes an obsession or priority. It's OK to want things, but it's not OK to let our happiness depends on (materialistic) things, 
  something that will become outdated or old, without any value couple of years from now, or that can be replaced easily with something 
  that is up-to-date. 
</p><br>

<p>
  From my own experience and perception, lasting (but not everlasting) happiness can be gained from three principles: first - by accomplishing some 
  challenging task or a goal. Second - by maintaining peace of mind and having freedom from negative emotions, external stimuli, 
  strong desire toward materialism. Third - by continually working on introspection, which is the examination of one's own conscious 
  thoughts and feelings. The third principle is more related to psychology, but I find it probably the most valuable one.
</p><br>

<p>
  At the end of the day, people are chasing happiness, trying to figure out the concept where one day they will be perpetually happy, 
  instead of realizing that perpetual (everlasting) happiness does not exist. We need to accept the fact that we cannot control anything 
  except our reaction to external stimulus, and this is hardest part to learn and probably the one thing that really can make you a true stoic.
