  Just recently I have finished reading 'Atomic habits' by James Clear and one takeaway that I find extremely valuable is: 
  'The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. 
  True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless 
  refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to <strong>the process</strong> that will determine your progress.'
</p><br>

<p>
  Technically, whether we are writing code or cooking breakfast [Timothy Kenny compared cooking with coding, even though he doesn't cook] 
  everything can be modeled as a repeatable process. Understanding the elements of production like inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, 
  quality controls, variability - lets us create and improve the system needed to fulfill our goals, with an ultimate goal 
  of high quality results in less time with least waste.
</p><br>

<p>
  If we need some high quality outcome, practical way to approach problem solving would be to write down processes, take measures and then iterate. 
  You cannot improve what you cannot measure. You cannot improve what you cannot explain. You cannot improve what you don't take action on.
  Always have in mind that you can optimize processes through experimenting, moving and removing barriers, or just by adding tools.
</p><br>

<p>
  OK, but how can we actually create some processes? When creating processes always lean on these variables:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Algorithmic way of thinking. Create algorithms with everything you do. Why? So you don't need to think about choices. 
      This reduces anxiety and creates mental clarity.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Reduction. Reduce options as much as you can. Why? 
      Limiting our actions in the future will reduce the choices we'll need to do.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flexibility. Make it as flexible as you can. Actually, make if fluid enough to keep up with changes. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Simplification. Make them as simple as possible. Simple processes are easier to understand and apply.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Simple and clear input leads to fast output. Show the results as soon as you can.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul><br>

<p>A group of processes can be viewed as a system, and systematical approach to problem solving is proven method
  for the fastest way of reaching beneficial outcome.</p><br>

<p>
  Another note that I consider to be very important is - time is very important, and in order to improve our skills 
  in certain area, we need to have in mind that constant practice is mandatory for certain period of time. No matter
  what are we trying to master, to be good at coding or brick laying, it all requires certain amount of time and practice. 
  As Warren Buffet said - 'You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant. It just doesn’t work that way.' Hence, 
  it's necessary to invest time into a skill that we want to master.
