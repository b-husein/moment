<p>
  Data engineering provides the foundation for data science and analytics. It also
  constitutes an important aspect of all businesses and it's a big part of the big
  data ecosystem, closely linked to data science.
</p><br>

<p>
  At the lowest level, data engineering involves the movement of data from one 
  system or format, to another system or format. As Paul Crickard says: "Using 
  more common terms, data engineers query data from a source (extract), they perform
  some modifications to the data (transform), and then they put that data in a location
  where users can access it and know that it is production quality (load)."
</p><br>

<p>
  The definition of data engineer above is broad and simplistic. I will use an example
  from Paul Crickards book to explain more visually a role of data engineer.
</p><br>

<p>
  An online retailer has a website where you can purchase widgets in variety of colors. 
  The website is backed by a relational database. Every transaction is stored in the database.
  How many blue widgets did the retailer sell in the last quarter? 
</p><br>

<p>To answer this question, you could run a SQL query on the database. This doesn't rise to 
   the level of needing a data engineer. But as the site grows, running queries on the production
   database is no longer practical. Furthermore, there may be more than one database that records
   transactions. There may be a database at different geographical locations - for example, the 
   retailers in North America may have a different database than the retailers in Asia, Africa and 
   Europe.
</p><br>

<p>
  To answer the preceding question, a data engineer would create connections to all of the transactional
  databases for each region, extract the data, and load it into a data warehouse. From there, you could 
  now count the number of all the blue widgets sold.
</p><br>

<p>
  In a real world example, instead of finding the number of blue widgets sold, data engineer would have to
  answer some questions like how do we find out which locations sell the most widgets, what is the peak time
  for selling widgets, how many users put widgets in their carts and remove them later, how do we find out 
  the combinations of widgets that are sold together?
</p><br>

<p>To answer these questions we would have to perform combination of extracting, loading, transforming data (ETL)
   and create a data pipeline. After that data would be placed into data warehouse where it would be queried.
